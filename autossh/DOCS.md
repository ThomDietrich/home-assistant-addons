# Home Assistant Add-on: Autossh

Use SSH to make ports of your local Home Assistant setup available at or through a remote system.
This forms yet another way to make the Lovelace UI and other services accessible from another network or the public internet.
If you do not have the authority to open ports into your local network, and a VPN solutions seems overkill, this add-on might just be the solution for you.

The solution is only useful to those with access to a publicly available SSH server and some administrative privileges on that system.

Autossh is a well known tool to establish an SSH connection and keep it connected over hours and months.
SSH is known for its high security and the ability to set up port forwardings in both directions through the SSH connection.
In combination, this add-on offers tunneled port forwarding functionality.

The solution works reliably and without disruptions.

## TL;DR;

Set `hostname` and `username`, start once to generate a key pair, copy key pair over to remote server, start again, check log for success or error messages. Do not forget to set your home network as a "trusted_proxy".

## Setup

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.
After the add-on is installed on your system, follow the instructions in the next few sections.

### Preparation of your Home Assistant Network Configuration

Please add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file.
For a description of this security measure see: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#trusted_proxies

```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 192.168.0.2  # Replace with the internal IP address of your Home Assistant host
```

### SSH Connection Credentials

After installation and first start, check the logs of the add-on to see further instructions and status details.
The add-on creates an SSH keypair and uses it to connect to the given host.
The public key can be found in the log after the first startup and **must** be copied to the remote server for this add-on to work.

On your typical remote server Linux system the public key is added to `<users home>/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
Do NOT add the key to the root user's `authorized_keys` file.
We recommend a dedicated user that doesn't have access to anything that isn't needed.
Alternatively consider the Docker solution (which provides separation by itself).

**Regarding the suggested `command` part of the public key printout:**

For additional security, we prepend some restrictions to the public key that [disallow anything](https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/openssh-server/authorized_keys.5.en.html#restrict) other than port forwarding on the remote server.
For this to work, you **must** leave the `-N` in the `other_ssh_options` section of the default config.
If you don't want to use these additional security measures, you can remove everything before the `ssh-ed25519 ...` part of the key printout.

Be aware that anyone with access to your local Home Assistant's file system (and thus the private key) will be able to log in to your remote server and can execute any command if the restrictions are not set.

### Remote Server Configuration

The remote server is the machine hosting the SSH Server and the counterpart for your tunnel connection.
All traffic using this add-on goes through it, a domain name dedicated to your Home Assistant instance must be bound to this servers address.  

By default, forwarded ports can only be bound to localhost.
To make it available on a public interface, either reconfigure SSH or set up a reverse proxy. A docker solution is given as the most secure and the cleanest solution overall.

#### Option 1: SSH GatewayPorts

Consider to set `GatewayPorts clientspecified` in sshd-config if you would like to open ports on other interfaces than localhost.

#### Option 2: Reverse Proxy

Use a reverse proxy to make ports accessible on public interfaces.
Software like Caddy can be used to not only set up the redirect, it will also automatically retrieve a Let's Encrypt certificate (https) if you own a domain name.

#### Option 3: Docker Based Solution

This is the recommeded strategy.
Set up a dedicated SSH server isolated within a docker container on the remote server. This solution minimizes the attack surface of the overall solution tremendously.

The code below shows a suited `docker-compose.yml` configuration, including an example how you would nicely combine this with traefik as a reverse proxy option (The further setup of traefik is not shown here and out of scope).

```yaml
version: '3.1'
services:
  homeassistant-autossh:
    image: linuxserver/openssh-server:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 1.2.3.4:2222:2222  # External SSH port, to be used with autossh by homeassistant
    networks:
      - traefik
      - default
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
      - USER_NAME=homeassistant
      - PASSWORD_ACCESS=false
      - SUDO_ACCESS=false
      - PUBLIC_KEY_FILE=/authorized_keys
    volumes:
      - ./openssh_config:/config  # Enable AllowTcpForwarding and GatewayPorts after creation during first run
      - ./authorized_keys:/authorized_keys:ro  # Store the generated ssh key here
    labels:
      traefik.enable: "true"

      traefik.http.routers.homeassistant-myhome.rule: Host(`myhome.domain.tld`)
      traefik.http.routers.homeassistant-myhome.tls.certresolver: resolver-gandi
      traefik.http.routers.homeassistant-myhome.service: homeassistant-myhome
      traefik.http.services.homeassistant-myhome.loadbalancer.server.port: 8123

networks:
  traefik:
    external: true
```

The respective addon config for this looks similar to this:

```yaml
hostname: 1.2.3.4  # or public domain
ssh_port: 2222
username: homeassistant
remote_ip_address: "127.0.0.1"
remote_port: 8123
```

## Configuration

### Option: `hostname`

The hostname of your SSH server (DNS or IP).

### Option: `ssh_port`

The SSH port on your SSH server (typically 22).

### Option: `username`

The username to be connected as on the SSH server.
Remember to store the generated public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` of this users home.

### Option: `remote_ip_address`

The IP address ON the remote server, on which you wish to provide the forwarded IP-port-socket (your HA UI).
This will typically be `127.0.0.1` to denote the localhost of the remote server.
Alternatively you may want to provide the public IP of your server.
Please refer to "Remote Server Configuration" if in doubt.

### Option: `remote_port`

The port number ON the remote server, on which you wish to provide the forwarded IP-port-socket (your HA UI).
You can set this port however you like. It's totally fine to keep the HA-typical port `8123`.

### Option: `local_ip_address` (optional)

This option specifies the IP address of wherever Home Assistant listens to on the local machine from which the SSH connection is being established.

If you are running on standard HASS and are experiencing issues, try to set this to `home-assistant`.
On the HASS OS 9.4+, the corresponding IP address should be `172.30.32.1`, earlier than HASS OS 9.4 used `172.17.0.1` instead.
The addon will also post all interface info during startup.

### Option: `local_port` (optional)

This option specifies the local port of wherever Home Assistant listens to on the machine from which the SSH connection is being established.

### Option: `remote_forwarding` (optional)

A list of generic SSH remote forwadings to be applied.
For this add-on, the most common setting was `127.0.0.1:8123:172.30.32.1:8123`, which forwards the Lovelace UI to the remote server.
However, this forwarding rule can conveniently be achieved by the use of `remote_ip_address` and `remote_port`.

### Option: `other_ssh_options`

Additional `ssh` options that will be added.
This is optional and for testing purposes a verbose output enabled by `-v` can be useful.

### Option: `force_keygen`

A key pair is generated when the container is first initialized in your environment.
Set this to `true` if you even need to urge to regenerate a key.
