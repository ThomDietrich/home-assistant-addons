# Changelog

## 1.4.0

- Security addition: Recommend an extended public key setup on the remote server that disallows anything other than port forwarding.
  **Existing users** should consider implementing this in their setup. Thanks to @karlbeecken (https://github.com/ThomDietrich/home-assistant-addons/issues/26, https://github.com/ThomDietrich/home-assistant-addons/pull/31)

## 1.3.4

- Improve main loop to ensure continued connection

## 1.3.3

- Fix startup issues when SSL/HTTPS is set up locally (https://github.com/ThomDietrich/home-assistant-addons/issues/22, https://github.com/ThomDietrich/home-assistant-addons/issues/24)
- Add shellcheck Github action

## 1.3.2

- Fix to include `remote_forwarding`. This was always intended and was a bug introduced last minute

## 1.3.1

- **Warning:** This version includes changes to the port forwarding configuration. Please run the update from the local network.
- **Existing Users:** You can now replace the obsolete remote forwarding setting by dedicated remote socket settings  
- Check the connectivity of the local socket, thanks to @hnykda

## 1.3.0

- Added a more streamlined and intuitive way to define the forwarding local/remote sockets: https://github.com/ThomDietrich/home-assistant-addons/pull/16
- Wrapped the main command in an infinite loop to survive temporary connection issues (https://github.com/ThomDietrich/home-assistant-addons/issues/17): https://github.com/Rjevski/home-assistant-addons/pull/1 

## 1.2.1

- Switched from the invalid test user 'test' to the known '$USERNAME' for the sake of fail2ban: https://github.com/ThomDietrich/home-assistant-addons/pull/18
- Added the printout of local IPs to help with https://github.com/ThomDietrich/home-assistant-addons/issues/14

## 1.2.0

- Changed default port forwarding rule to be compatible with HassOS 9.4+ (https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/pull/2246)
- Breaking with HassOS 9.4: Existing users will lose their connectivity due to the changed network settings. You have to change the port forwarding rules after or directly prior to the OS upgrade 

## 1.1.0

Attention: v1.0.9 introduced a change you should pay attention to during an update.
Please set `other_ssh_options` to `-N` or `-N -v` (`N`: no login, just a tunneling connection; `v`: verbose logging)

- Replaced "config.json" by "config.yaml"
- Added changelog file

## 1.0.9

- Moved ssh argument `-N` to default configurable options so it can be removed (fixes #1)

## 1.0.8
